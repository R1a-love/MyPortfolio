        My name is Mary Victoria Requillmanim.
         I am 11 years old. My birthday is on June 20 and I live
         in the Philippines, located in South East Asia. I also like to be called Ria.
         It's my nickname. Please call me that. Anyway, I go to school at Saced Heart Hijas de Jesus,
          which is a Chinese school
          and was founded by Saint Candida Maria de Jesus.
        I'll be Grade 7 next year. Two of my hobbies are reading and baking.
        My favourite authors are Rick Riordan and Shannon Messenger. 
        I have a twin brother called Tyler, and a little sister named Clawdine. We like to play and
        swim. A random fact: when I was making this I decided to prank my teacher. When I spelled
        spelled me name I put Requillmanim for my last name when it's actually Requilman.
        And she thought it was true. And she also thought we were foreigners. I never corrected her.
        And she still beleives it. I don't think I'm goig to tell her this, though. But, Trainer Mylene,
        if you're reading this, my last name isn't Requillmanim, it's Requilman. Sorry! </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:25px; color:blue; font-family:Courier New; font-weight: bold;">
          The hobby I enjoy the most is reading. I first started to like reading books
         when I was Grade 4.
        The first book series I liked to read was Geronimo Stilton by Elisabetta Dami.
        The series that I like most are PercyJackson by Rick Riordan 
        and Keepers of the Lost Cities, by Shannon Messenger.
        My favourite sweets to bake and eat are brownies, cookies, and cupcakes.
